chaojia74051@sina.com,B07D818MTX,5,Really good foot massager for a very low price,"Initially I bought this foot massager machine for Mother's to give it to my Mom. She absolutely loves the prodict! Now whenever she sits in the living room, her feet are getting massaged after a long day at work. The build quality is good, quite lightweight so you can carry it with no problem. The massage feature is very relaxing and it has 3 different modes from which you can chose from. Overall really great product and no downsaids. If you are looking to get one of these you shouldnt hesitate! The brilliant shiatsu foot massager makes when on is quit calming and you wouldn't notice it if you were watching TV. It's also great that you can unzip the liner cloth and wash the foot holes. I don't usually write reviews but this product has been so amazing I just had to. Thank you for such an amazing foot spa massager. We may be ordering another a gift. Great product.",,
linyi82040@sina.com,B07D818MTX,5,"Works fantastically well,very happy with purchase.","I wanted to treat my partner to a foot massager as he often works 5/6 full long days on his feet, and the get aches and pains. After looking at various ones I decided this was the one to get. When it arrived I opened the box to check all contents were Ok, read through instructions and decided to have a try. It's really easy to set up and use. The instruction booklet is small and easy to read and follow. The massager has 3 different levels, plus the option of heat or no heat. On my first go, I found it felt quite tight on my feet, it felt strange, but comfortable.I've since used it a few times and have to say I love it. I like massage with heat, my feet feel better and I feel relaxed afterwards. Each level has a timer, this is the same for each one, 15 minutes. It will automatically cut off after this time but for me 15 minutes is perfect.",,
