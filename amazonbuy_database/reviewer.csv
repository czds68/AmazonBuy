ningxiao6938695@sina.com,B07DBD51KT,5,Highly super resolution monitor camera and picture quality fantastic,"Delighted with this wireless security camera, really easy to set up! Picture quality fantastic. You can use your phone to move the camera, talk through the camera and receive text messages if any motion is detected at specific times of the day ie: night time, etc. Setting up is very fast. Simply download the SotionCam app on ios / android and follow the step by step. This took me 10 minutes and was effortless. After setup has finished, you then have immediate control over your camera. I changed my settings and recording schedule without any issues. Changing the camera positions and brightness / contrast is a nice feature as well. Loads of great features included and really simple to setup. Recording footage is automatic (need micro sd) and you can view the recorded clips from the app as well. You can change the camera position live by swiping motion with your fingers on the live screen. So good, I bought a second one, which you simply add as a second camera to your app. I would like to attach some pictures of what you see via the app. I would recommend this camera monitor to anyone who is interested in a affordable camera.",,,系统
linyi82040@sina.com,B07DBBP3W2,5,Super clear night vision that images captured and video recorded well.,"Even if I hadn’t purchased this wireless camera in a recent flash sale, I would still be very impressed with it. The setup was very easy you download the app, scan the QR code on the base of the camera to acquire the camera ID and input the camera default password 8888, then click ""Apply"". Super clear night vision up to 30 feet. Intelligent motion detection alarm/alert and video recording for your home/business security; support real time video recording and micro SD card recording; playback the images captured and video recorded on the App or PC anytime. The daylight images are very good, with accurate colours, but it is black and white at night that the camera really impresses. I have mine looking outside through a window, so I had to turn the infrared lights off, but even in very low light, the camera is still able to see a surprising amount of detail.  The movement feature then has 7 sensitivity levels. Another feature I like is that no matter what SD card recording option you have selected, you can still manually record or take photos from the camera while ‘live viewing’ the image on your smartphone, so if for example, your camera is only set to record at night, you can still record to your phone whenever you like.

xiaojing40525@sina.com,B07DBD51KT,5,Special app and software design for the wireless camera,"Special app and software design based on user's needs; one minute quick setup and extremely reliable Wi-Fi connection; Remote access and control the real time video and monitor easily for all ages. Not for the faint hearted to set up. Once set up monitor camera, was simple and easy to use and access the camera. Did buy a separate SD memory card and overall camera quality is good in the day and night being clear. It’s not of them cheaps where your not able to see anything and the camera is self is a good quality. I purchased this pet camera to catch the ""cat"" burglar that was sneaking in at night & helping himself (or herself!) to our two cat's food. It turns out our cats were happy with the company and it was like a pyjama party! It was so easy to set up. I didn't need to connect it to the router with an ethernet cable, just with my mobile phone ! I have it set on motion detector alert, and whilst work. The night vision is really clear. I love this camera and software - nothing technical or complicated. I would recommend this camera to any wannabe techie without the techie know how !",,,系统
qvh3184@sina.com,B078SKZ1PG,5,Very nice kneading massager for you back,"Have a look at this kneading massager that made up my mind to buy this cheaper version. It is great, I didn't think that a massage chair could massage so deeply, you can start with a gentle rolling up and down to loosen your muscles, then turn on the shiatsu massager and lean into to it as much as you feel. Either way still a great massage, would recommend using this on a firm sofa/ chair with back cushioning. If your reading this then just Buy it as you won't be disappointed.",,,
kzd5924@sina.com,B078SJXTHB,5,This chair back massager is far beyond my expectations.,"This kneading massager chair is far beyond my expectations. Use this once a week, especially after a real hard days work. I do some heavy stuff, and work to very tight deadlines. Sometimes doing stuff that the crane should do. Sit down, relax, and get back to yourself again. Far beyond my expectations. A really good chair with proper kneading for the lower back. As other people mentioned previously, the chair can have the kneading effect around the shoulder area.",,,
kiw5630@sina.com,B078SKZ1PG,5,Amazing delivery serviceand equally amazing product,"Great massaging chair with heat. Gives a deep massage that really works your back. Fantastic after deadlifting. The vibration function on the upper legs could be improved. It was my new toy every day when it first arrived. amazing delivery - next day - and on a sunday, was well surprised with how quick it was delivered. it so surprising how deep it can massage the muscles. I'm satisfied with this back massager that it can tend to massage my neck area well enough.",,,
