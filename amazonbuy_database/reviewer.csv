Great sound quality and extremely comfortable. I can wear them hours and basically forget that I've got them on. I'm very happy with this purchase. With delivery through Amazon they arrived in perfect condition and very quickly. Finally a Bluetooth headset with decent range! And the earpieces don't fall out either when running. Rather spend the $25 here than $300 on Beats by Dre. Sound is pretty good too. Please turn on the headphone when it is charging, the LED light will be in blue when it is full. And it is in red color when charging.",,
fengjun36400@sina.com,B07DBD51KT,5,This is an amazing little wireless camera!,This is an amazing little wireless camera! I still can't believe you get all of this technology for the price! It sends a notification when motion is detected; it has night vision; it is easy to set/change positions; it can move in all directions including pretty much 355 degrees horizontally. It can all be worked remotely from your smartphone - even without a wireless connection. It allowed us to monitor our cats and make sure they were ok durning we are on vocation. I am definitely getting another one for a different part of the house. ,,

My old massage machine died, so I bought this. Really glad I did. It has three modes, three intensity settings and optional heat. Takes a bit of getting used to, especially as it squeezes your feet very firmly during the cycle but it really made my feet feel much better afterwards.",,
xiaoli533950@sina.com,B07CSHFCL5,5,The massage intensity level works perfectly for my mum,"Brought this foot massager electric for my mum as a Mother's Birthday's Day gift because shes been complaining about some pain on her foot. I think the pain originated when she started taking up jogging as a hobby so I though it would be a good idea to get her this to relieve some pain on her foot. She loves it and has told me that it's really soothing and has helped release the tension on the foot. The massage has 3 mode and intensive setting, the low intensity level works perfectly for my mum. The heat is optional.",,
pianya76380@sina.com,B07CK34LX3,5,Virtual Reality Masturbation Cup feels really good. ,"The Male Masturbation Stroker Cup feels great. First time purchasing a product of this nature. Packaging was discrete. Pleasantly surprise with the feel and the performance. Virtual Reality Masturbation Cup feels really good. I have seen other fleshlight costing two to three times. I would definitely suggesting purchasing this product first. Overall, my husband and I were satisfied with the product and if you are starting off with trying something new for “him” I would recommend you start with this to keep the fire buring! 
The plastic covering keeps all liquids inside the product inside. Easy to use. The texture on the inside feels great and realistic, provides maximum pleasure. Cheap price for the amount of pleasure that one can receive. Comes in nice packaging, I love how discreet the container is.",,
