Easy to use brilliant for keeping an eye on your pet first class back up from the makers definitely recommend. Picture quality is good, night vision is also very good. Just what I need to keep an eye on the pets when I'm out of the house. I bought a SD card to record motion detection. It is very easy to set the motion detection recording settings. Please don't foget to enable the motion detection first, and then choose the ""ON alarm"" for record type. Very happy with my purchase.",,

buxue012647@sina.com,B07DBD51KT,5,The wireless IP camera picture quality is reasonable,"This is a pretty good wireless IP camera with night vision for the money. The picture quality is reasonable, and the night vision ability isn't bad. The IR illumination won't work if your camera is looking through a window, as the glass just reflects back all the IR and blinds the camera. If you want to monitor outdoors when it is very dark out, then you will have to put the camera outside. It works well for monitoring dark rooms indoors though. What is more, the motion detection works well too. It will save 1-3 captured  images in App once it detects motion each time. The two way audio works well too.",,
