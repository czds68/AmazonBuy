zhanxin575006@sina.com,B077R8CQ7W,5,Very satisfied with this foot massager for circulation!,"Very satisfied with this foot massager for circulation! After first used I felt really relaxing! Wish I'd purchased this year ago! It's very comfortable to be able to relieve fatigue, and it's a great fit for my husband who has to work all the time. So relaxing! Would definitely recommend this foot massager, it take a while to get used to the pressure on your feet but it does the trick!",,
longnan4821405@sina.com,B077R8CQ7W,5,Amazing foot massager machine and highly recommend.,Bought this foot massager machine for my mum as she suffers with a lot of pain in her feet. Literally used it for 15 mins and she's already walking better! Loved it! A little firm at first but great once you get used to it. Everyone in the family uses it. I also used it and it felt amazing! Amazing machine and highly recommend.,,
