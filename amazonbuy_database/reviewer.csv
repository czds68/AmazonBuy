ouya00396@sina.com,B07CXKHSCW,5,It works perfectly! Simple to use. Highly recommended!,"Great for price and very good quality and quiet design, this wifi or cable connected camera unit is great and works well with advised app. Easy to set up the smart camera by followed the quick setup guide. Image is very good on HD resolution. Night vision also good too.  Honestly, this took about 10 minutes to set up, then plug it in to the appropriate place - bingo, it just works! Pretty easy to install and a better quality image than expected. seems a good quality product for the price. I am using it to just check up on my pet dog, so we can start the app wherever we can get a signal and just see him. It also works perfectly, even if there is no lighting. You can move the camera around and look at different areas, and monitor the sound. I have not used the security monitor feature or recorded the pictures, cheap as chips. Simple to use. Highly recommended.",,

Sotion security camera monitor comes with everything you need to start recording straight away. Well explained Instruction manual inside. Dc plug and internet cable comes with it. I like the fact the monitor camera has night vision mode. Impressive auto-cruise bookmarks.It was easy to set up and using the app both on my iphone and ipad is perfect for adjusting final settings.The image is also of good quality.Most happy with my purchase. The camera its self made with very good strong plastic, wont get damaged very easily. I would recommend this series security camera for office and home use very easy to install and use. This is the second one we've purchased after trying the first out while we were away on holiday. Worked fine and easy to use. Good budget option.",,
yisen91306@sina.com,B07CXKHSCW,5,Excellent security camera super clear night vision,"Bought this wifi camera a couple of weeks ago, it was easy to set up and use. Use this to keep an eye on my dog and it works great. The plus points are it sets of an alert on my phone on motion detect, the picture quality is good in daylight but I do put an outside light on at night as the reflection on the window it is facing out of obscures the image. This monitor camera super clear night vision up to 30 feet. Intelligent motion detection alarm/alert and video recording for your home/business security; support real time video recording and micro SD card recording; playback the images captured and video recorded on the App or PC anytime. It works well, I have caught a couple of foxes on my drive at night and can distinguish them apart. You can tilt and pan from your phone and even listen to voices. Overall a great little camera and I would recommend it. Great camera night and day. Only problem i had was connecting wirelessly but sorted now. Advise to anyone struggling to connect use the Ethernet cable supplied to connect first and it should connect wirelessly after a minute or so. Even though had the connecting problems still giving 5 stars.",,
huanbin7913716@sina.com,B07DBBP3W2,5,Great little two-way audio camera with microphone and speaker,"Brought this pet camera to watch my dog while I'm not home, found it difficult to link via Wi-Fi however once plugged directly into router was easy to setup for wireless viewing. I can say something to my dog and it very happy to respond to me. Advanced two-way audio with high quality integrated microphone and crystal audio output speaker. Listen and talk with your baby or family anytime / anywhere. Support 4 live videos showed up on the same phone/tablet screen, where you can watch over your baby / pets / elder / home in sharp real time video simultaneously. Fantastic quality video footage; not difficult to set up (if you follow the instructions carefully); easy to programme preferred views; motion detection not only triggers recording of a short clip, but also sends alert to your mobile phone - I now know there is someone approaching my front door before they press the bell! Great security camera with great quality. Does the job I need it to do so would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive camera. Great picture great app. So good I brought a second one which easily linked with my present one using the same method.",,
