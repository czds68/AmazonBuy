juanxing516192@sina.com,B07CXKHSCW,5,Works well. Good quality. Happy with Purchase.,"Can't rate this any less than 5 stars. Absolutely superb value, the pet camera is easy to set up and use. The device is perfect size and gives a great picture, the resolution can be changed to make it better, or make it less incentive to stream if you are away from home with not to much data. It can also be changed to night vision or you can keep it with daylight. Everything is controlled via the app which is usable via an internet connection and not just over a LAN connection, all the settings can be changed depending on your situation. There is also the ability to record which is also a great addition. This is a nice camera for the price, would recommend!",,
yizi0282850@sina.com,B07D818MTX,5,I Love this foot massager! Feels wonderful on my feet! ,"I bought it because I wear high heel shoes in my work and after work I have to walk to pick up my kids from school. I definitely need to relax my foot after 8 hours a day! This massager I use it everyday when I am watching TV in sofa or before I go to bed, it is really comfortable and relaxed. The massager with heat and kneading, and a roller underneath your foot. There are 3 settings you can choose, normally I use the strongest with heat, it gives you strong massage and comfort, it won't give you any pain. Now my husband loves it as well, and inner part with a zip so that it can be removed and washed, it is a good design.",,
zejia9580236@sina.com,B07CXKHSCW,5,Really good and very well priced picture quality is really good.,"Amazing little wireless camera that seems professionally made and comes with full instructions. There is no subscription cost, you just plug in the camera then download the app, follow the instructions on the app and its set up in minutes. I initially set it up using an Ethernet cable but then moved the camera to somewhere else in the room and the wifi connected straight away. Has a nice picture quality and to be able to control the camera remotely is an excellent feature, just scroll around on your phone screen and the camera pans and zooms. the 2 way voice thing is also really good.",,
