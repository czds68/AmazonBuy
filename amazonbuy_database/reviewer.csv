qianjia74051530@sina.com,B07DBBP3W2,5,The security camera has a good price and service supports,"I had a question about adding my cameras in the App to a new phone. I contacted the seller support, so full marks to seller again for service. My first camera was purchased in 2016 and has never missed a beat, not only that, the service support was prompt when I asked a question about the manual. I now have three brand cameras for security purposes but the old one needed replacing so that I could turn off the LEDs at night. If you try to use it indoors through a window the LEDs reflect back and you can’t see anything. With the LEDs off the outside security camera provides all the light I need. This camera seemed an ideal choice at a good price and supports a micro SD card so that you can check on events. It can set the motion detection settings and sent the alert message to your App and saved the detected images in App for checking later. For me this was important and unlike some others, it doesn’t have to go to an offshore server somewhere. When you get an alert message you can quickly view the camera via the App and if necessary use the audio facility to talk to whoever triggered the motion detection. So I now have the IP Camera, my old unit and this one, each fulfilling a slightly different task and doing their jobs well.",,

Just download the app and follow the quick setup instructions, pointing your phone camera at the label on the underside sets up the camera on the app with default settings, and then enter the password for your wifi set up. So you should be up and running in less than 10 minutes. A full user manual is supplied in the box and the print is just large enough for my old eyes to read, the manual is also provide how to use SotionCam App. You can scan the QR code(shown below) to download and install SotionCam App. Select the right version for your device(IOS or Android). You can also download SotionCam App from Play Store(Android) or Apple Store(iOS). The free App is also available from their website, at download center. Another reviewer shows the box contents when received so I haven’t repeated this. The video and snapshot quality is excellent and for my use as a security camera is good enough to capture lifelike images of any events. ",,
