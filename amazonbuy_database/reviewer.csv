xinman41926@sina.com,B07CSGSFQM,5,The kneading back massager is really nice. Works as it should be.,"It's a very good massager cushion with heat, after a long day of work I need a massage, I got rid of the back pain and am very pleased with this massage chair, is all I needed for a massage. The back massage is really nice. It does deep into the back and makes you feel uncomfortable at first, but then you start to feel the massage properly. This is amazing! Out the gym, hop into the car and turn it on. The cushion massager has just right amount of pressure and is quite relaxing. Controls are easy to understand and use. Very relaxing. Really easy to use. It can be used in the house or in the car through the 12V socket provided. On the seat there is a vibration - quite pleasant so i am using it often. ",,
linyi82040@sina.com,B07CSGSFQM,5,All the massage programmes will be take turns eventually.,"I bought a massage cushion for my mother a few years ago, and I always want something similar as a treat to myself. I was a bit worried the strength is not hard enough though, but when I got this and tried it, itâ€™s amazing. Vibrating Massage is great. Leave it on automatic to do its job and it takes it down all the massage programmes eventually. Now my husband and me sit on it everyday after work and relax! It ca n stop itself after every 15 min.",,
