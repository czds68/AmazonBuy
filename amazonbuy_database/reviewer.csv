qvh3184@sina.com,B078SKZ1PG,5,Very nice kneading massager for you back,"Have a look at this kneading massager that made up my mind to buy this cheaper version. It is great, I didn't think that a massage chair could massage so deeply, you can start with a gentle rolling up and down to loosen your muscles, then turn on the shiatsu massager and lean into to it as much as you feel. Either way still a great massage, would recommend using this on a firm sofa/ chair with back cushioning. If your reading this then just Buy it as you won't be disappointed.",,,
kzd5924@sina.com,B078SJXTHB,5,This chair back massager is far beyond my expectations.,"This kneading massager chair is far beyond my expectations. Use this once a week, especially after a real hard days work. I do some heavy stuff, and work to very tight deadlines. Sometimes doing stuff that the crane should do. Sit down, relax, and get back to yourself again. Far beyond my expectations. A really good chair with proper kneading for the lower back. As other people mentioned previously, the chair can have the kneading effect around the shoulder area.",,,
kiw5630@sina.com,B078SKZ1PG,5,Amazing delivery serviceand equally amazing product,"Great massaging chair with heat. Gives a deep massage that really works your back. Fantastic after deadlifting. The vibration function on the upper legs could be improved. It was my new toy every day when it first arrived. amazing delivery - next day - and on a sunday, was well surprised with how quick it was delivered. it so surprising how deep it can massage the muscles. I'm satisfied with this back massager that it can tend to massage my neck area well enough.",,,
